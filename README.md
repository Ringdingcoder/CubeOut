CubeOut
=======

This is a remake of the 3D Tetris "Block Out". I didn't write it, I just made a few modifications. The original lives on [Chrome Experiments](http://www.chromeexperiments.com/detail/cubeout/?f=) and was done by [alteredq](https://github.com/alteredq).

My modifications correct the way the pieces rotate. Animation can get a little jaggy occasionally, but everything behaves as it should. I did not intend to make this perfect but merely playable.
